\section{Constraints and Design Trade-offs}

\subsection{Hardware Constraints}
\textbf{C1: VR Headset Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Meta Quest 3 processing power (Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2) limits polygon count and texture resolution in standalone mode
    \item Trade-off: Prioritize frame rate stability (72 FPS minimum) over ultra-high-resolution textures to prevent motion sickness
    \item Solution: Implement dynamic LOD (Level of Detail) and occlusion culling; use PC-VR link for high-fidelity scenarios
\end{itemize}

\textbf{C2: Bluetooth Latency and Bandwidth}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bluetooth 5.0 offers ~10–30ms latency but is susceptible to interference in crowded 2.4 GHz spectrum
    \item Trade-off: Accept slight latency increase versus wired connection complexity and user mobility restrictions
    \item Solution: Use BLE with custom GATT profiles optimized for low-latency HID data; implement USB fallback mode
\end{itemize}

\textbf{C3: Force Feedback Absence}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Custom-built steering wheel lacks motorized force feedback present in high-end simulators ($>$\$10,000)
    \item Trade-off: Reduced haptic realism versus significant cost savings (force feedback wheels alone cost \$1000–3000)
    \item Solution: Compensate with visual cues (steering resistance indicator on HUD), audio feedback (tire squeal), and vibrational alerts via Quest 3 controllers
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software and Performance Constraints}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Unity/Unreal default vehicle physics are optimized for gaming, not driver training accuracy
    \item Trade-off: Computational cost of high-fidelity tire models (e.g., Pacejka Magic Formula) versus frame rate
    \item Solution: Use simplified but validated physics models (mass-spring damper for suspension, friction circles for lateral grip) with parameter tuning from real vehicle data
\end{itemize}

\textbf{C5: Asset Development Budget}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Photorealistic 3D models of licensed vehicle interiors (Mercedes, BMW) require substantial licensing fees or extensive 3D modeling effort
    \item Trade-off: Generic high-end vehicle interiors versus brand-specific accuracy

    \label{fig:workflow}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Detailed Functional Flow}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Pre-Session Setup (2–5 minutes):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Instructor selects trainee profile, training scenario (e.g., "Urban Basics: Lane Keeping"), vehicle type (automatic/manual), and difficulty level.
        \item Trainee dons Quest 3 headset; system initiates guardian boundary setup and comfort calibration (IPD adjustment, brightness).
        \item Hardware connection handshake: Steering wheel, pedals, and shifter auto-pair via Bluetooth; system runs diagnostic check (sensor ranges, battery level).
        \item Virtual environment loads: vehicle spawns at scenario starting position; HUD displays initial instructions ("Adjust seat, check mirrors, fasten seatbelt").
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Simulation Loop (15–30 minutes typical session):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Input Capture (20 Hz):} ESP32 samples sensors (steering angle, pedal positions, gear state) → transmits via BLE HID packets.
        \item \textbf{Physics Update (60 Hz):} Unity's FixedUpdate applies forces to vehicle rigidbody based on input → calculates acceleration, tire slip, suspension compression.
        \item \textbf{Collision \& Traffic AI (30 Hz):} Raycast-based collision detection; traffic agents follow waypoint paths with lane-change logic; pedestrians obey traffic signals.
        \item \textbf{Rendering (90 Hz):} Stereoscopic camera renders scene from driver's viewpoint → foveated rendering reduces peripheral detail → Quest 3 displays frames.
        \item \textbf{Audio Spatialization (60 Hz):} FMOD calculates 3D engine sound (RPM-dependent), tire squeal (slip-dependent), horn/indicator clicks → Quest 3 speakers.
        \item \textbf{Real-time Assessment:} Background thread logs events (speed violations, lane crossings, harsh braking) → updates live feedback HUD (color-coded indicators).
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Event Handling:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Scenario Triggers:} Dynamic events (e.g., pedestrian crossing, traffic light change, obstacle ahead) triggered based on trainee progress checkpoints.
        \item \textbf{Instructor Override:} Wireless tablet interface allows real-time weather change, traffic density adjustment, or scenario pause for coaching feedback.
        \item \textbf{Comfort Monitoring:} Optional: Detect prolonged stationary gaze (potential nausea indicator) → suggest break.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Session Termination:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Trainee completes scenario objectives (e.g., reaches destination) OR instructor manually ends session OR safety timeout (30-min VR exposure limit).
        \item System saves session data: timestamped input logs, trajectory GPS coordinates, metric summaries.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Post-Session Assessment (2 minutes):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Assessment module computes scores: (1) Speed Compliance (85/100), (2) Lane Discipline (78/100), (3) Smooth Braking (92/100), (4) Gear Shifting (Manual only, 88/100), (5) Observation (mirror checks, 70/100).
        \item Generates PDF report with score breakdown, heatmap of violations on route map, improvement suggestions.
        \item Updates trainee profile: increments training hours, marks scenario as "Passed" (if overall $>$ 75\%) or "Retry Recommended."
        \item Instructor reviews report with trainee; schedules follow-up session or progresses to advanced scenarios.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
